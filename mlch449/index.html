                    <h3>Founder - Siddhartha Gautama "Buddha"</h3>
                    <p>Siddhartha Gautama, also known as Buddha (which loosely translate to "enlightened one" or "the awakened"), lived as a prince in Nepal during the 6th to 4th century B.C. According to the popular story of his life, after experimenting with different teachings for years, and finding none of them acceptable, Gautama spent a night in deep meditation. During his meditation, all of the revelations he had been seeking became clear, and he achieved full enlightenment, thereby becoming known as the Buddha.</p>
                    <h3>At a Glance</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buddhism is 2,500 years old</li>
                        <li>With currently 376 million followers worldwide</li>
                        <li>As of 2001, there are between 3 to 4 million Buddhists in the United States.</li>
                        <li>Does not beleive in a personal God and is not centered on the relationships between humanity and God</li>
                        <li>Believe that nothing is permanent; change is always possible</li>
                        <li>Life is both endless and subject to impermanence, suffering, and uncertainty. These states are called the <i>tilakhana</i>, or the three signs of existence. Existence is endless because individuals have reincarnated over and over again, experiencing suffering throughout many lives.</li>
                        <li>The path to Enlightenment is through the practice and development of morality, meditation and wisdom.</li>
                        <li> Worship takes place in both temples and homes</li>

                    <h3>The Four Noble Truths</h3>
                    <p>Since life is full of suffering, Buddhist believe following the Four Noble Truths will liberate oneself from suffering.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Suffering</li>
                        <p>As stated above, life always invole suffering, in obvious and subtle forms. Even when things seem good, we always feel an undercurrent of anxiety and uncertainty inside.</p>
                        <li>Cause of Suffering</li>
                        <p>The cause of suffering is craving and fundamental ignorance. We suffer because of our mistaken belief that we are a separate, independent, solid “I.” The painful and futile struggle to maintain this delusion of ego is known as <i>samsara</i>, or cyclic existence.</p>
                        <li>The End of Suffering</li>
                        <p>The good news is that our obscurations are temporary. They are like passing clouds that obscure the sun of our enlightened nature, which is always present. Therefore, suffering can end because our obscurations can be purified and awakened mind is always available to us.</p>
                        <li>The Path</li>
                        <p>By living ethically, practicing meditation, and developing wisdom, we can take exactly the same journey to enlightenment and freedom from suffering, as Buddha did.</p>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Noble Eightfold Path</h3>
                    <p>By following the Noble Eightfold Path, individuals can attain the state of Nirvana by freeing from attachments and delusions and thereby understand the innate truth of all things. This path, therefore, helps one with one’s ethical and mental growth and development.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Right View</li>
                        <p>One must see things in the right perspective; seeing things without any false illusions or pretenses. Buddha wanted his followers to see and to understand the transient nature of worldly ideas and possessions and to understand that they can attain salvation only if they practiced the right karma.</p>
                        <li>The Right Intention</li>
                        <p>What goes on inside our minds (our thought process) determines our course of action. It is, therefore, necessary to follow the path of Right thought or Right Intention. To have the Right Intention or the Right Thought, a person should be aware of his purpose or role in life and is studying the teachings of Buddha.</p>
                        <li>The Right Speech</li>
                        <p>Buddhist must speak the truth, to avoid slander and malicious gossip and to refrain from abusive language. Harsh words that can cause distress or offend others should also be avoided while also staying clear of mindless idle chatter which lacks any depth.</p>
                        <li>The Right Action</li>
                        <p>One must behave peacefully and harmoniously; the Right action lies in complying to the following guidelines:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Staying in harmony with fellow human beings</li>
                            <li>Behaving peacefully</li>
                            <li>Not stealing</li>
                            <li>Not killing anyone</li>
                            <li>Avoiding overindulgence in sensual pleasure</li>
                            <li>Abstaining from sexual misconduct</li>
                            <li>Not indulging in fraudulent practices, deceitfulness, and robbery</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The Right Livelihood</li>
                        <p>One must make a living righteously, without resorting to illegal and nefarious activities; cannot exploit other human beings or animals or trade in weapons or intoxicants.</p>
                        <li>The Right Effort</li>
                        <p>Buddha believed that human nature imposes undue restrictions on the mind at times, causing a person to harbor ill thoughts. So we have to train our mind to think in the right direction if we wish to become better human beings. Once we gain control over our thoughts and replace the unpleasant ones with positive ones, we shall be moving in the right direction.</p>
                        <li>The Right Mindfulness</li>
                        <p>The Right Mindfulness, together with the Right Concentration, forms the basis of Buddhist meditation. By proposing this, Buddha suggests his followers focus mentally on their emotions, mental faculties, and capabilities while staying away from worldly desires and other distractions.</p>
                        <p>It refers to the ability of the mind to see things as they are without being led astray by greed, avarice, anger and ignorance.</p>
                        <li>The Right Concentration</li>
                        <p>This eighth principle laid down by Buddha is fundamental for proper meditation. Zazen (or, Zen meditation) is the way used in Zen to reach the right concentration or "state of mind". Needless to add, this is the most vital of all the aspects stated in the Noble Eightfold path since, without proper meditation, an individual cannot move on to a higher level of well-being.</p>

                    <h3>Founder - Confucius</h3>
                    <p>Confucius (551 B.C. to 479 B.C.), also known as Kong Qui or K’ung Fu-tzu, was a Chinese philosopher, teacher, and political figure. His teachings, preserved in the Analects, focused on creating ethical models of family and public interaction and setting educational standards. After his death, Confucius became the official imperial philosophy of China, which was extremely influential during the Han, Tang and Song dynasties.</p>
                    <h3>At a Glance</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confucianism is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system developed from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius.</li>
                        <li>Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang (c. 1600 BCE–1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE).</li>
                        <li>This complex system of thought includes moral, social, political, philosophical, and quasi-religious thought. It has had a considerable influence on the culture and history of East Asia.</li>

                    <h3>Analects of Confucius</h3>
                    <p>The Analects are a collection of the teachings and thoughts of Confucius; they also contain fragments of dialogues between the great Chinese philosopher and his disciples. The name in English derived from the word "analect" which means a fragment or extract of literature, or a collection of teachings. In Chinese, the book is literally called "discussion on the words [of Confucius]." The Analects are believed to have been collected by the disciples of Confucius and not by the sage himself.</p>
                    <p>Written during the Period of Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period (ca. 479 BC - 221 BC), the Analects are considered among the most representative works of Confucian thought, and still have a great influence on Chinese culture and East Asia.</p>
                    <h4>The Importance of the Ceremony</h4>
                    <p>The Analects are a long and seemingly disorganized book of short events, filled with strange conversations between Confucius and his disciples, like this one:</p>
                    <p>‘Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.</p>
                    <p>The Master said, ‘Tsze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony’. </p>
                    <p>Confucius is reminding Tsze—and us—about the importance of the ceremony.</p>
                    <p>In the modern world we tend to shun ceremony and see this as a good thing—a sign of intimacy, or a lack of pretension. Many of us seek informality and would like nothing more than to be told ‘just make yourself at home!’ when visiting a friend. But Confucius insisted on the importance of rituals. The reason he loved ceremonies more than sheep is that he believed in the value of li: etiquette, tradition, and ritual. </p>
                    <p>This might seem very outdated and conservative at first glance. But in fact, many of us long for particular rituals—that meal mum cooked for us whenever we were sick, for example, or the yearly birthday outing, or our wedding vows. We understand that certain premeditated, deliberate, and precise gestures stir our emotions deeply. Rituals make our intentions clear, and they help us understand how to behave. Confucius taught that a person who combines compassion (‘ren’) and rituals (‘li’) correctly is a ‘superior man’, virtuous and morally powerful. </p>
                    <h4>Treating Parents with Reverence</h4>
                    <p>Confucius had very strict ideas about how we should behave towards our parents. He believed that we should obey them when we are young, care for them when they are old, mourn at length when they die and make sacrifices in their memory thereafter. ‘In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently’, he said. ‘When he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur’. He even said that we should not travel far away while our parents are alive and should cover for their crimes. This attitude is known as filial piety (‘xiào’).</p>
                    <p>This sounds strange in the modern age when many of us leave our parents’ homes as teenagers and rarely return to visit. We may even see them as strangers, arbitrarily thrust upon us by fate. After all, our parents are so out of touch, so pitifully human in their shortcomings, so difficult, so judgmental—and they have such bad taste in music! Yet Confucius recognized that in many ways moral life begins in the family. We cannot truly be caring, wise, grateful and conscientious unless we remember Mum’s birthday and meet Dad for lunch.</p>
                    <h4>Obedience to Honorable People</h4>
                    <p>Modern society is very egalitarian. We believe that we’re born equal, each uniquely special, and should ultimately be able to say and do what we like. We reject many rigid, hierarchical roles. Yet Confucius told his followers, ‘Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, a father a father, and a son a son’.</p>
                    <p>This might sound jarring, but it is, in fact, important to realize that there are people worth our deep veneration, even our simple and humble obedience. We need to be modest enough to recognize the people whose experience or accomplishments outweigh our own. We also should practice peaceably doing what these people need, ask, or command. Confucius explained, ‘The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows across it.’ Bending gracefully is, in fact, not a sign of weakness but a gesture of humility and respect.</p>
                    <h4>Cultivated Knowledge is More Important than Creativity</h4>
                    <p>Modern culture places a lot of emphasis on creativity – unique insights that come to us suddenly. But Confucius was adamant about the importance of the universal wisdom that comes from years of hard work and reflection. He listed the aforementioned compassion (‘ren’) and ritual propriety (‘li’) among three other virtues: justice (‘yi’), knowledge (‘zhi’) and integrity (‘xin’). These were known as the ‘Five Constant Virtues’. While Confucius believed that people were inherently good, he also saw that virtues like these must be constantly cultivated just like plants in a garden. He told his followers, ‘At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.’ He spoke about moral character and wisdom as the work of a lifetime. (We can see now why he had such reverence for his elders!)</p>

                    <h3>Founder - Lao Tzu</h3>
                    <p>Lao Tzu or Laozi, who existed in the 6th century B.C, was the founder of the Chinese philosophical ‘School of the Tao’ or ‘Taoism’. The origin and life of Laozi is extremely ambiguous and even after centuries of research very little is known about his life. Nevertheless, his teachings have been handed down through centuries and today his followers are manifold. Laozi’s philosophy was particularly known have been prominent during the Han Dynasty, though the philosopher lived in the Zhou Dynasty, the longest surviving dynasty in primeval China.</p>
                    <h3>At a Glance</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taoism originated in China 2000 years ago</li>
                        <li>With currently 20 million followers worldwide</li>
                        <li>It is a religion of unity and opposites; Yin and Yang. The principle of Yin Yang sees the world as filled with complementary forces such as; light and dark, hot and cold, and so on</li>
                        <li>The Tao is not God and is not worshipped. Taoism includes many deities, that are worshipped in Taoist temples, they are part of the universe and depend, like everything, on the Tao</li>
                        <li>Taoism promotes achieving harmony with nature, the pursuit of spiritual immortality being 'virtuous', and self-development.</li>
                        <li>Taoist pratices include meditation, feng shui, fortune telling, and reading and chanting of scriptures.</li>

                    <h3>Beliefs</h3>
                    <h4>Tao</h4>
                    <p>The Tao is not a thing or a substance in the conventional sense.</p>
                    <p>It cannot be perceived but it can be observed in the things of the world. Although it gives rise to all being, it does not itself have being.</p>
                    <p>Although it's conventional to refer to The Tao, some writers think that the "the" should be dropped because it isn't in the original Chinese term.</p>
                    <p>They feel that using 'the' gives Westerners the idea that the Tao is a metaphysical reality, by which they mean a thing (in the widest sense) or an absolute being like a god.</p>
                    <p>But even the name Tao can lead Westerners to think of Tao in the same way that they think of objects.</p>
                    <p>That sort of thinking is misleading: Thinking of the Tao as some sort of object produces an understanding of the Tao that is less than the reality.</p>
                    <p>It might be more helpful to regard Tao as a system of guidance. And if one does this one can translate 'achieving union with the Tao' into 'developing oneself so as to live in complete conformity with the teachings of the Tao' which is easier to understand, and closer to the truth.</p>
                    <h4>Gods &amp; Spirits</h4>
                    <p>Taoism does not have a God in the way that the Abrahamic religions do. There is no omnipotent being beyond the cosmos, who created and controls the universe. In Taoism, the universe springs from the Tao, and the Tao impersonally guides things on their way.</p>
                    <p>But the Tao itself is not God, nor is it a god, nor is it worshipped by Taoists.</p>
                    <p>Taoism has many gods, most of them borrowed from other cultures. These deities are within this universe and are themselves subject to the Tao.</p>
                    <p>Many of the deities are gods of a particular role, rather than a personal divine being and have titles rather than names.</p>
                    <p>Books often describe the Taoist pantheon as a heavenly bureaucracy that mimics the secular administrations of Imperial China. Some writers think that this is the wrong way round and that the secular administrations took their cue from the structure of the heavens. Since the Imperial administrations and the religious culture of the time were closely intertwined this would not be surprising.</p>
                    <h4>Religious &amp; Philosophical Taoism</h4>
                    <p>The word Taoism is used to refer to both a philosophy and a set of spiritual doctrines as well as an extensive ritual hierarchy and monastic institution. Although textbooks often distinguish between 'religious' and 'philosophical' Taoism, this is an artificial distinction and is no more than the difference found in all religions between the practices of the faith, and the theological and philosophical ideas behind them.</p>
                    <p>A more useful distinction might be between Chinese Taoism and Westernised Taoism because some forms of Westernised Taoist philosophy add unauthentic new age and other faith elements to Taoism, while removing much of its religious content; and few Western 'Taoists' include Taoist gods and goddesses, liturgy, worship, or specifically religious meditative practices in their religious life.</p>
                    <p>Taoism is often taught in the West as an atheist or agnostic philosophy, but in China and Taiwan particularly, Taoism still functions like any conventional religion, and not like an abstract philosophy of life.</p>
                    <p>There are Taoist temples, monasteries and priests, rituals and ceremonies, and a host of gods and goddesses for believers to worship. These are as vital to the survival of Taoism as individual understanding and practice.</p>
                    <p>Taoism's rich palette of liturgy and ritual makes the Tao more real to human beings and provides a way in which humanity can align itself more closely to the Tao to produce better lives for all.</p>
                    <p>The religious elements of Taoism draw much of their content from other Chinese religions (including many local cults), and so enfold a very wide range of culture and belief within the wings of the Tao.</p>
                    <p>The many traditions within the Taoist framework give priests the tools to carry out the conventional tasks of any religion: worship, healing, exorcism, intercession, purification, divination and so on.</p>
                    <p>Most Taoist temple practices are designed to regulate the relationship between humanity and the world of gods and spirits and to organize that relationship, and the relationships in the spirit world, in harmony with the Tao.</p>

                    <p><b>All three of the ancient Chinese philosophies, mentioned above, are quite similar, it is more likely that one's ideas and principles line up with more than one of the philosophies.</b> Unfortunately, I was unable to make a quiz that gave more than one result.</p>
                    <p>When I was given free rein to create my final project, I immediately decided I would create a website. But, to be unique I decided to create a "Buzzfeed style" personality quiz based on a subject in ancient China that I find interesting, the ancient Chinese philosophies. I decided to focus on Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism since they are very similar.</p>
